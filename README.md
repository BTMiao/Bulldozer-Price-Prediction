# Bulldozer-Price-Prediction
In this project, we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer. The price dataset is provided by Kaggle Bluebook for Dulldozers (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview). We use regression since we need to predict a number. The data preprocessing pipeline, the regression model, and the data deployment can be find in the file "bulldozer-price-prediction.ipynb".
